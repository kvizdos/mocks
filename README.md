# Mocks
This is a repo of mocks for NodeJS testing. In it, there are some mocks that already exist, e.g. mongo mocks, and some that *already exist*, but don't have good docs, like the Discord mocks.

## Available mocks:
- Mongodb
- DiscordJS (for bots)

## How to use it?
Let's take DiscordJS as an example.
